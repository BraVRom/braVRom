I'm 27 yo. IT Sysadmin and Cybersecurity specialist. Originally from the Canary Islands, I have an innate passion for computing and video games, especially fighting games, platformers and RPGs since I was very young, I was fascinated by the homebrew scene and console modding, starting with the PSP and Wii.

Throughout my life, I have cultivated a deep interest in computer science, the field in which I consider myself most proficient. In addition, I have developed significant skills in video editing and graphic design, using tools such as the Adobe family and Vegas Pro.

I am a technology enthusiast, passionate about video games and computer systems. I love to experiment and learn constantly.

I finished my studies in cybersecurity recently, and I am looking forward to continue gaining experience in this field with knowledge and skills in incident management, vulnerability analysis and advanced protection measures.

I have created this profile to share my academic work and personal projects. Although I am not an expert programmer, I invite you to explore my repository and see what I have been doing in my spare time.
